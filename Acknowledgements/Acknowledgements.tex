The writing of this manuscript closes a period of almost four years dedicated to science. It has made me grow both 
personally and technically and I am very grateful for the opportunity. In the way, I have had the chance to meet 
formidable scientists, technicians, and friends, which I will try to mention in the following paragraphs. \\

I started tasting science in my bachelor thesis with Aitor and Ion. I continued working with them in the Master 
thesis and we continued together in the Ph.D. thesis. I think we have had the chance to make fascinating science. I 
could not have chosen better supervisors. You are not only passionate scientists, but also honest people who I 
appreciate. Obviously this work would not have been possible without your support. I would specially like to thank 
Ion for his daily and close dedication. \\

I would like to acknowledge my current institute Centro de F\'isica de Materiales and all the people working in it. I 
would also like to thank the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC) and its computing center service, as part 
of the computational work presented in this thesis was done on the DIPC supercomputers. The rest of the computational
resources where provided by Marenostrum and PRACE. The financial support was provided by the Material Physics 
Center. \\
