Thermoelectricity is a material property with an endless application list. It can be used to generate electricity 
from a temperature gradient, which can be waste heat coming from a combustion engine. It can be also applied in the 
reverse way to transform a voltage into a temperature gradient. This application is mainly exploited in the 
microchip cooling technology. A research line in the thermoelectric community is to find materials with a higher 
thermoelectric efficiency. Another research line tries to find and understand physical and chemical mechanisms that 
increase the thermoelectric efficiency. Even though these research lines have a long history, the main challenge is 
to find materials or mechanisms to apply these materials in an industrial way. The state of the art materials have 
very low efficiencies, which make them only useful in very specific applications. \\

The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is measured by the figure of merit $ZT=S^{2}\sigma T/\kappa$. $S$ is the
Seebeck coefficient, $\sigma$ the electrical conductivity and $\kappa$ the thermal conductivity. With a $ZT$ of 3 
in a broad temperature range, the thermoelectric materials would be competetitive against the heat engines in terms of
heat transformation into electricity. In Fig. \ref{ztvst} we show the $ZT$ of record thermoelectric materials as a 
function of the year when they were discovered or synthesized.

As we can see, there is no material with a $ZT_{max}$ as high as three. Even though there are some materials with a 
$ZT$ of 2 or higher, usually this only happens for very narrow temperature ranges. This limits the applications of 
these materials. \\

The main problem behind the increase of the $ZT$ is the fact that the physical magnitudes that are involved are 
correlated. This correlation goes against high $ZT$s. In Fig. \ref{decouple} we show a cartoon of the physical 
magnitudes as a function of the doping for a given temperature.

The power factor $PF$ is the product of the squared Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. The idea 
behind a good thermoelectric material is very simple. We need materials with a high power factor and low thermal 
conductivity, the so called electron crystals and phonon glasses. However, if we have a look to Fig. \ref{decouple}
we can see that the power factor has a clear limitation. The electrical conductivity increases as a function of the 
carrier concentration, however, the Seebeck coefficient has the opposite trend, which makes the PF to have a peak 
that cannot be increased. On top of this, the thermal conductivity of typical semiconductors increases as a 
function of the carrier concentration. This further decreases the carrier concentration at which the maximum $ZT$ 
but does not open any possibility to increase the $ZT$. \\

There are different ways to increase the thermoelectric efficiency of a material by physical and chemical 
manipulation. Materials have been doped\cite{kim2013engineered,pei2011stabilizing,heremans2008enhancement} or
nanostructured\cite{vineis2010nanostructured,minnich2009bulk} in order to get a high power factor combined with a 
low thermal conductivity, yielding, i.e., $ZT\simeq 2.2$ in PbTe\cite{hsu2004cubic}. In the proximity to a phase 
transition $ZT$ may also soar, as in the case of Cu$_{2}$Se\cite{liu2013ultrahigh}, where the thermal conductivity 
is abruptly decreased close to the transition, reaching $ZT$ values as high as $2.5$. \\

In the last years, it has been shown that intrinsic semiconductors with an intrinsically low thermal conductivity 
may be materials with a very high $ZT$. The total thermal conductivity is the sum of electronic and lattice thermal 
conductivities. In intrinsics semiconductor, the main contribution to the thermal conductivity comes from the 
lattice. Therefore, the challenge is to find intrinsic semiconductors with an instrinsically low lattice thermal 
conductivity. The best thermoelectric material in this family is SnSe with a $ZT_{max}$ of 2.6. This material is 
not only the best thermoelectric in this family, but the best thermoelectric material overall. \\

At this point, theoretical material science plays a crucial role. Theory could reduce the experimental effort by 
searching for materials with an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity. The first-principles calculation of 
the lattice thermal conductivity is a complicated task and it is computationally demanding. Anyway, nowadays it is 
included in the toolkit of any theoretical material scientist. However, it has been found, that the intrinsically 
low lattice thermal conductivity is associated, in many cases, to a strongly anharmonic lattice. This is the case, 
for instance, in SnSe. The strong anharmonicity not only causes low thermal conductivity, it also creates 
interesting properties, such as, structural phase transitions. These structural phase transition, in many cases, 
make the thermoelectric materials more efficient. However, materials that suffer structural phase transitions are 
in many cases unstable within the harmonic approximation, on top of which, all the theory for calculating the 
lattice thermal conductivity is built by using perturbation theory. The calculation of the transition temperature 
in these phase transitions is, for the same reason, a complicated task. In the last years there have been several 
methods and implementations that try to overcome these problems. \\

The main purpose of this thesis is to understand and predict this structural phase transformation that occur in 
thermoelectric materials and study what is the role they play in the thermoelectric efficiency. Once the structural 
and vibrational properties of these materials are studied, another purpose is to calculate the lattice thermal 
conductivity and understand what makes it so low in these materials with high $ZT$. For this purpose we have chosen 
the most efficient thermoelectric material SnSe and its isoelectronic counterpart SnS. In order to account for the 
anharmonic effects at a non-pertubative level we have applied the so called stochastic self-consistent harmonic 
approximation (SSCHA). \\

In many cases, this structural phase transitions break the inversion symmetry of the material. This opens the door 
to interesting physical properties, such as, ferroelectricity. It has been shown that both properties, high 
thermoelectric efficiency and ferroelectricity, can coexist in the same material as it happen in SnTe. There is a 
experimental work showing that the dimensionality could dramatically change the transition temperature to the 
ferroelectric state. In the same work they show that in this material has a robust ferroelectric state that can be 
switched with an electric field. This kind of materials are very interesting for industrial applications. We have 
tried to understand this ferroelectric phase transition in monolayer SnSe. \\

Where do I include the intro for the anharmonic effects in the ZA mode of graphene?
