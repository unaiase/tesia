Thermoelectricity is a material property with an endless applications list. It allows to transform 
a temperature gradient into a voltage via the Seebeck effect\cite{li2009thermoelectric,yang2006thermoelectric}. In 
the reverse way, it allows to transform a voltage into a temperature gradient via the Peltier 
effect\cite{disalvo1999thermoelectric,zhao2014review}. The state of the art materials have very low thermoelectric 
efficiencies, which make them only useful in very specific applications. For example, one of the main power 
generation historical applications of thermoelectric materials has been the radioisotope thermoelectric generator 
for NASA's spacecrafts\cite{yang2006thermoelectric}. Recent materials advances and an increasing awareness of energy 
and environmental conservation issues have rekindled prospects for automotive applications. Regarding the cooling 
applications, thermoelectric devices are interesting in electronic cooling, due to their high reliability and 
compact packaging\cite{zhao2014review}. For these reasons, the two fundamental research lines in the thermoelectric 
community are the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find and synthesize materials with a higher thermoelectric efficiency.
\item Find and understand physical and chemical mechanisms that increase the thermoelectric efficiency. \\
\end{enumerate}

The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is measured by the figure of merit $ZT=S^{2}\sigma T/\kappa$. $ZT$ is 
a dimensionless number. $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient, $\sigma$ the electrical conductivity, $T$ the temperature, 
and $\kappa$ the thermal conductivity. With $ZT\simeq3$ in a broad temperature range, the thermoelectric materials 
would be competetitive against combustion engines in terms of efficiency in transforming heat into 
electricity\cite{zhang2015thermoelectric}. In Fig. \ref{ztvst} we show the maximum figure of merit $ZT_{max}$ of 
record thermoelectric materials as a function of the year when they were discovered or synthesized.

reference\cite{zhang2015thermoelectric}.}
\label{ztvst}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
As we can see, there is no material with $ZT_{max}$ as high as 3. Even though there are some materials with a 
$ZT_{max}$ of 2 or higher, usually this only happens for very narrow temperature ranges\cite{zhao2014ultralow}. This 
limits the applications of these materials. \\

The power factor $PF$ is the product of the squared Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. The idea
behind a good thermoelectric material is very simple. We need materials with a high power factor and low thermal
conductivity, the so called electron crystals and phonon glasses. The main problem behind the increase of $ZT$ 
is the fact that the physical magnitudes that are involved are correlated among themselves. This correlation limits 
the $ZT$. In Fig. \ref{decouple} we show a cartoon of the physical magnitudes that appear in the numerator of $ZT$ 
as a function of the doping for a given temperature. We choose to plot the physical magnitudes as a function of the
doping because it is one of the simplest manipulations to be applied. 
\begin{figure}[h]

carrier concentration in a typical semiconductor.}
\label{decouple}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
If we have a look to Fig. \ref{decouple} we can see what is the fundamental limitation of the power factor. The 
electrical conductivity increases as a function of the carrier concentration, however, the Seebeck coefficient has 
the opposite trend, which makes the $PF$ to have a peak that cannot be increased without further different 
manipulations. On top of this, the thermal conductivity of typical semiconductors increases as a function of the 
carrier concentration. This further decreases the carrier concentration at which the maximum $ZT$ but does not open 
any possibility to increase $ZT$. Obviously, apart from the fundamental limitations given by correlation, there are 
practical and technical limitations. \\

There are different ways to increase the thermoelectric efficiency of a material by physical and chemical 
manipulation. Materials have been doped\cite{kim2013engineered,pei2011stabilizing,heremans2008enhancement} or
nanostructured\cite{vineis2010nanostructured,minnich2009bulk} in order to get a high power factor combined with a 
low thermal conductivity, yielding, i.e., $ZT\simeq 2.2$ in PbTe\cite{hsu2004cubic}. It has been shown that, in the 
proximity to a phase transition $ZT$ may also soar, as in the case of Cu$_{2}$Se\cite{liu2013ultrahigh}. In these 
cases the thermal conductivity abruptly decreases close to the transition, reaching $ZT$ values as high as $2.5$. \\

In the last years, it has been shown that intrinsic semiconductors with an intrinsically low thermal conductivity 
may be materials with a very high $ZT$\cite{zhao2014ultralow,he2018remarkable}. The total thermal conductivity is 
the sum of electronic and lattice thermal conductivities. In intrinsics semiconductor, the main contribution to the 
thermal conductivity comes from the lattice as there are not many available charge carriers at normal temperatures. 
Therefore, the challenge is to find intrinsic semiconductors with an instrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity. 
The best thermoelectric material in this family is SnSe\cite{zhao2014ultralow} with a $ZT_{max}$ of 2.6. This 
material is not only the best thermoelectric in this family, but the best thermoelectric material overall. \\

At this point, theoretical material science plays a crucial role. Theory could reduce the experimental effort by 
searching for materials with an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity. The first-principles calculation of 
the lattice thermal conductivity is a complicated task and it is computationally demanding\cite{broido2007intrinsic}. 
Anyway, nowadays it is included in the toolkit\cite{giannozzi2009quantum} of any theoretical material scientist. 
However, it has been found that, the intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity is frequently associated to 
a strongly anharmonic lattice\cite{zhao2014ultralow,ribeiro2018strong}. This is the case, for instance, in SnSe. The 
strong anharmonicity not only causes low thermal conductivity, it also creates interesting properties, such as, 
structural phase transitions. These structural phase transitions, in many cases, make the thermoelectric materials 
more efficient\cite{liu2013ultrahigh}. However, materials that suffer continuous structural phase transitions are, 
usually, unstable within the harmonic approximation, on top of which, the theory for calculating the 
lattice thermal conductivity is built by using perturbation theory\cite{paulatto2013anharmonic}. The calculation of 
the transition temperature is, for the same reason, a complicated task. In the last years there have been several 
methods and implementations\cite{hellman2013temperature,ljungberg2013temperature,magduau2013identification} that try 
to overcome these problems. \\

One of the main purposes of this thesis is to understand and predict this structural phase transformations that occur 
in thermoelectric materials and study what is the role they play in the thermoelectric efficiency. Once the 
structural and vibrational properties of these materials are studied, another purpose is to calculate the lattice 
thermal conductivity and understand what makes it so low in these materials with high $ZT$. For this purpose we have 
chosen the most efficient thermoelectric material SnSe and its isoelectronic counterpart SnS. In order to account 
for the anharmonic effects at a nonpertubative level we have applied the so called stochastic self-consistent 
harmonic approximation\cite{errea2013first,errea2014anharmonic,bianco2017second,monacelli2018pressure} (SSCHA). \\

In many cases, these structural phase transitions break the inversion symmetry of the 
material\cite{ribeiro2018strong,chang2016discovery}. This opens the door to interesting physical properties, such 
as, ferroelectricity. It has been shown that both properties, high thermoelectric efficiency and ferroelectricity, 
can coexist in the same material as it happen in SnTe\cite{ribeiro2018strong,zhang2013high}. There is an 
experimental work\cite{chang2016discovery} showing that the dimensionality could dramatically change the transition 
temperature to the ferroelectric state. In the same work\cite{chang2016discovery} they show that 
monolayer SnTe has a robust ferroelectric state that can be switched with an electric field. Thin film ferroelectrics 
are key for modern device applications\cite{lallart2011ferroelectrics}. However, it is known that there is a critical 
thickness for thin ferroelectrics, below which the depolarization field destroys the ferroelectric 
state\cite{batra1973new,zhong1994giant,dawber2005physics}. This effect decreases the transition temperature to the 
ferroelectric state as a function of the sample thickness\cite{fong2004ferroelectricity,fong2006stabilization} and 
sets a fundamental limit for technological applications. Monolayer SnSe could suffer a similar phase transition to 
SnTe, which makes it a very promising candidate for technological applications. In this thesis we have studied 
the ferroelectric phase transition in monolayer SnSe\cite{chang2020controlled}. We have also tried to study the 
thermal properties of monolayer SnSe. \\

As shown in the previous paragraph, there could be two dimensional (2D) multifunctional materials, which are 
interesting in the thin film technologies. The acoustic out-of-plane vibrational modes play a crucial
role\cite{lindsay2010flexural} in the heat transfer in two dimensional materials. The understanding of the mechanical 
and thermal properties of these phonon modes is far from trivial. Even the possibility of having crystalline order 
in 2D has been long questioned\cite{landau_statistical_physics,mermin1968crystalline} due to the existence of these 
modes. It has been theoretically shown that the harmonic approximation fails\cite{katsnelson2013graphene} in the 
understanding of the acoustic out-of-plane mode, leading to unphysical consequences. Motivated by this and the 
frustrated attempts to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer SnSe, which could be affected by the 
mentioned problems, we have studied the anharmonic effects in the out-of-plane acoustic phonon modes of graphene. \\

Long made short, the purpose of this thesis is to study the anharmonic effects in materials where the harmonic 
approximation and perturbation theory break down. For that purpose we have chosen technologically relevant 
candidates, such as, very efficient thermoelectric materials, 2D ferroelectrics, and graphene. In chapters 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 we show the theoretical background needed to study the electronic, vibrational, and thermal properties of the 
materials. In chapters 5 and 6 we show the results corresponding to bulk SnSe and SnS thermoelectrics. In chapter 7 
we study the vibrational properties of monolayer SnSe. Finally, in chapter 8 we study the anharmonic effects in the 
atomic vibrations of graphene.
